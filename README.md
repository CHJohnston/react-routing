# Exercise: React Router Hooks

The API we will be using: Studio Ghibli API

This will be a continuation from the React Routing Exercise.

Objective#
Your objective is to continue from the React Routing Exercise to create an individual page view for each data object from the lists previously used in the routing exercise. For example, each Studio Ghibli film should have it's own page view.

Getting Started#
Open your command line and navigate to your repos directory (if you do not have a repos folder, then you can use mkdir repos to create one)
You will be using the same React Routing repository as the previous lesson.
Open the App.jsx file to get started
Steps#
We will be using the Studio Ghibli API to make calls, and display data in our application, depending on our current url route.
Studio Ghibli API
For each of the endpoints that you created earlier with routes to display the data:
Create new components for individually displaying each value of data in the lists youâ€™ve displayed
Add new routes to display these components when a route url is matched, using the data id as params
Create individual components for at least three datasets (e.g. people, places, vehicles, etc)
You should be able to click on a film, character, etc from your list page that takes you to the view page for the item that was selected.
